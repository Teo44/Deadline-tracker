# Deadline-tracker

A web application for keeping track of deadlines. Currently registered users can add deadlines with a name and a time to complete them, mark them as completed and delete them. Deadlines can also be filtered, ordered and divided into categories, which can also be given a priority. 

The application in it's current state is running on [Heroku.](https://deadline-tracker.herokuapp.com)
