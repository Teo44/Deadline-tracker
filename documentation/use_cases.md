# Use cases of deadline-tracker

The goal of deadline-tracker is to make keeping track of deadlines simple for users, while offering useful functionality for both the regular and power users. On the most basic level, users will be able to add deadlines, tasks that must be completed before a certain date and time, and mark them as done.  

The deadlines can be grouped into categories, and divided into tasks that must all be completed before the deadline. The deadlines are also given a priority, ranging from "would be nice to get done" to "must absolutely get done". 

Existing tasks can sorted and selected by their categories, priorities and required time of completion.

A possible use case might be a college student, with multiple deadlines from different courses. These could all be added to deadline tracker, grouped by the course and possibly given different priorities, making scheduling assignments a breeze.
